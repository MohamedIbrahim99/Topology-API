# Topology-API

### API library which does the following :
1. Read and write topologies to and from disk.
2. Stores multiple topologies in memory.
3. Execute operations on topologies.

All of this to provide the functionality to access, manage and store device topologies.


### Functional Requirements
Provide the functionality to :
1. Read a topology from a given JSON file and store it in the memory.
2. Write a given topology from the memory to a JSON file.
3. Query about which topologies are currently in the memory.
4. Delete a given topology from memory.
5. Query about which devices are in a given topology.
6. Query about which devices are connected to a given netlist node in a given topology.

### ⛏️ Used Technologies

- IntelliJ - IDE
- Maven - Build tool
- JUnit - Testig
- JSON.simple - Json parser 
- [Code analysis] - Code analysis tools builtin IntelliJ


Developed this project is in an object-oriented manner.

### Why JAVA is used as the programming language

- Java is an object-oriented programming language. So it's a good choice to be used to model the API in an appropriate way.
- Java is supported by powerful Serialization and Deserialization JSON parsers like JSON.simple, GSON and Jackson.
